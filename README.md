We present SOLO (Sun Off, Lights On), a monocular day-to-night translation method
that can be used to translate a daytime semantic segmentation dataset into a nighttime one
by converting each daytime image to its nighttime counterpart while preserving the original
semantic segmentation annotations. To the best of our knowledge, SOLO is the first monocular
physically based approach in 3D for simulating nighttime.
